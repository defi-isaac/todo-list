/*

    Experiment with composition / inheritance here
        e.g. can either do name.edit, name.add etc or we can have an add/edit class and run name under that

    setComplete
        change some piece of data
        link the data to colour of checkbox

    removeTask

    name

    dueDate

    editTask
        change task display to a new form
        when submit button is pressed, read data and reassign

    addTaskBtn (always there)
        get data from form modal
        store data so it can be access by like addTask.name, addTask.dueDate, addTask.priority etc
            this will then be used to add to DOM
